# O Colapso da Civilização

Website developed as part of the final project for the class Design Editorial em Meios Digitais, integrated into the master's degree in Design and Multimedia at the University of Coimbra. 

The outline for the project was to create a digital and interactive adaptation of the book *O Colapso da Civilização* by João Fonte Santa. We were free to explore our own interpretation of the book, which we did by constructing a dystopian choose-your-own-adventure narrative based on a selection of illustrations included in the book. 

Implemented with the help of [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).
